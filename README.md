# Title
HR Insights & Trends - HR Analytics SQL Project‚Äã

# Introduction
This project aims to analyze employee data to uncover key Human Resource trends and insights, focusing on attrition, demographics, salary patterns, and workforce segmentation for strategic HR decision-making.‚Äã

# Objective
Assess and visualize employee attrition trends by age, education field, job role, salary slab, and years of service.

Explore department-level education demographics to inform hiring and retention strategies.

Use SQL queries to extract and summarize workforce statistics for data-driven recommendations.‚Äã

# Tools Used
SQL (Structured Query Language) for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis from the HR analytics database.

Data visualization tools/dashboards (as shown in the screenshot) for visual insight presentation.
# Data Cleaning Process
Checked for null values in critical fields like Employee ID to ensure data completeness ("select count as totalnullrecords from hranalytics where empid is null").‚Äã

Filtered and grouped records by key categories such as age, salary slab, department, job role, marital status, and business travel to enable targeted analysis.

Aggregated and validated counts for total employees by age group, department, and salary slab to maintain data integrity.‚Äã

# Analysis and Findings
Overall attrition rate is 16.12%, with the highest attrition observed among Life Sciences and Medical education fields.‚Äã

Attrition is most prevalent in the 26-35 age group and among employees with salaries below 5k.‚Äã

Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives experience the highest job role attrition.‚Äã

Most attrition occurs in the initial years of service, with a peak around 1 year of employment.‚Äã

Department education demographics show dominant representation in Life Sciences and Medical fields.‚Äã

# Conclusion
Employee attrition is significantly influenced by age, education, salary slab, and job role, suggesting the need for targeted retention strategies.

Data-driven HR analytics, using SQL and visualization, offer actionable insights for reducing attrition and improving workforce planning.

Effective data cleaning and validation are critical to ensure analysis accuracy and reliability.‚Äã
